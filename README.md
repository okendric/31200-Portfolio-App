## I tried to use the Scrollspy Bootstrap feature to automatically highlight parts of the navbar to choose what portion of the website the user is on when they scroll to it. I think it's a great feature to have so that it's clear to users what parts of the website are the ones they want to go to. I was able to get this feature to partially work, I couldn't get the highlighting feature to work but I was able to get the link being clicked on and bringing the user to a portion of the website to work.
